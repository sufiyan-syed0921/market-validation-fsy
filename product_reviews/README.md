# Product Review Data Processing & Analysis

The primary objective of this segment of the research is to gain insights toward RQ1: 

*Understand whether users of flight simulation yokes perceive feel, smoothness, and precision issues in current market offerings*.

Our primary method to acheive this goal involved a qualitative analysis of product reviews on online retail websites selling the yokes. Additionally in a survey we administered after this analysis, we included a question to ask directly users of these yokes if they have any issues with the features described in RQ1 (See full survey work here: LINK).
