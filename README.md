# Market Validation Report: Flight Simulation Yoke 

## Background

This repository aims to summarize research results from an exploratory analysis on the outcome of introducing an additional product offering in the flight simulation yoke controller market.

The proposed product has one main advantage over current market offerings, which we aim to test: an increased perceived feel, smoothness, and precision of yoke movement at a price point under $400. Our main product competitors we outlined for this analysis is the Turtle Beach: VelocityOne, Honeycomb Aereonatical XPC, and the Thrustmaster TCA Boeing. 

Given this, we set out to answer 3 key questions in an attempt to validate a market for this product. Here are the questions and our methodological approach for each question: 

### Research Question 1: Understand whether users of flight simulation yokes perceive feel, smoothness, and precision issues in current market offerings.​

### Research Question 2: Determine the value users place on the feel, smoothness, and precision of a flight yoke relative to other features.​

### Goal 3: Assess the comparative desirability of the current product against its primary competitors.​
